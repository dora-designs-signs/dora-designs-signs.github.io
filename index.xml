      <description>We can machine or laser cut your design, artwork or product!
We can also add engravings, markings or burning to an existing product. Add a permanent logo, artwork, lasered image, or special message for a life event. Phone cases, knives, Ipads, cutting boards, glasses, just to name a few.
Some materials are better suited for certain cutting processes - if you are unsure of the best way, just ask us! Some materials, such as Vinyl, cannot be lasered due to harmful fumes released when burned.</description>
